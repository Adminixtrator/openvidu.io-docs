	Current version of OpenVidu Pro matches <strong>version 2.8.0</strong> of OpenVidu Community Edition. We are not currently charging anything for using OpenVidu Pro, as we intend these first versions to be a beta. The only price you will have to pay is the cost of the Amazon instance, as you would do when <a href="/docs/deployment/deploying-aws/" target="_blank">deploying OpenVidu Community Edition in AWS</a>

## Why

OpenVidu is an **open source project**, and for sure will remain this way in the future. But OpenVidu team needs some source of income to continue working on this amazing project. The approach we'll be taking here is pretty straightforward: OpenVidu features themselves will always be open source, and only some tools or improvements related to **production environments** may end up being part of OpenVidu Pro stack. To sum up:
<br><br>

> You will always be able to access OpenVidu awesome features and build whatever you want with them. Our intention is to make OpenVidu platform long-term sustainable by offering **advanced production stage monitoring and management tools** for those companies interested in such capabilities

## Pricing

OpenVidu Pro will be priced through AWS Marketplace. Any piece of software offered in AWS Marketplace has two different charges: the cost of the AWS resources running the software and the cost of the software itself. Software manufacturers specify this second charge, and it is the only revenue they receive from the total cost of the stack. Having made this clear:

- The moment you cancel your OpenVidu Pro subscription in AWS Marketplace, no more charges will be applied. You only pay for the time you are running the service.
- OpenVidu Pro is considered a beta version right now, and for this reason no extra fees will be charged for the software part.
<!--- When releasing a final version, OpenVidu team may decide to offer OpenVidu Pro free of charge when deploying it on certain AWS instance types, so companies are able to try it on small machines before acquiring a bigger instance for real production setups.-->
