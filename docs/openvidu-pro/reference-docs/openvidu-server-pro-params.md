<h2 id="section-title">OpenVidu Server Pro configuration parameters</h2>
<hr>

OpenVidu Pro provides all of [OpenVidu CE configuration parameters](reference-docs/openvidu-server-params){:target="_blank"}, but also includes some extra parameters of its own.

| Parameter       | Description                               | Default value                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_LICENSE` | License key of your OpenVidu Pro account. This parameter is mandatory to launch OpenVidu Pro clusters.<br>**[Sign up now to get your free trial!](https://openvidu.io/account)** |  |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER`                   | Whether to launch OpenVidu in cluster mode or not. See [Scalability](openvidu-pro/scalability/){:target="_blank"} section to learn more | ***false*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_ID`                | Unique identifier of your cluster. Each OpenVidu Server Pro instance corresponds to one cluster. You can launch as many clusters as you want with your license key. Cluster ID will always be stored to disk so restarting OpenVidu Server Pro will keep the same previous cluster ID if this configuration parameter is not given a distinct value | _A random string_ |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT`       | Where is OpenVidu Pro cluster deployed. This way OpenVidu Pro will be able to manage the infrastructure on its own. Can be: [`docker`, `aws`, `on_premise`]. See [Scalability](openvidu-pro/scalability/){:target="_blank"} section to learn more | ***docker*** (suitable for development environments) |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_MODE`              | Mode of cluster management. Can be `auto` (OpenVidu manages Media Nodes on its own. Parameter [`KMS_URIS`](reference-docs/openvidu-server-params/#configuration-parameters-for-openvidu-server){:target="_blank"} is ignored) or `manual` (user must manage Media Nodes. Parameter [`KMS_URIS`](reference-docs/openvidu-server-params/#configuration-parameters-for-openvidu-server){:target="_blank"} is used: if any uri is provided it must be valid) | ***auto*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_AUTODISCOVERY`     | Whether to automatically add all running Media Nodes in reach of OpenVidu Pro or not. This is `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT` dependant and only enabled if `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_MODE` is set to `auto` | ***true*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_MEDIA_NODES`       | The desired number of Media Nodes on startup. First the autodiscovery process is performed. If there are too many Media Nodes after that, they will be dropped until this number is reached. If there are not enough, more will be launched. This only takes place if `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_MODE` is set to `auto` | ***1*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_LOAD_STRATEGY`     | What parameter should be used to distribute the creation of new sessions (and therefore distribution of load) among all available Media Nodes. Can be:<br> • `streams`: load calculated counting the number of media streams flowing through the Media Node<br> • `sessions`: load calculated counting the number of OpenVidu sessions hosted by the Media Node<br> • `mediaObjects`: load calculated counting the number of low-level media objects inside the Media Node (WebRtc streams, RTSP streams, recorder endpoints... any low-level media processing element). This is the most accurate measure, but it also requires asking each Media Node to return their internal information each time load is calculated | ***streams*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_PATH`              | Path where OpenVidu Server Pro will manage cluster-related files. This includes: looking for custom infrastructure management scripts and storing temporal output files with instances information | ***/opt/openvidu/cluster*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_CLUSTER_TEST`              | If true, OpenVidu Server Pro will perform a quick test on startup to check the clustering features:  it will launch a Media Node, connect to it and finally drop it. OpenVidu Server Pro logs will inform about the test execution in detail. Immediately after finishing the test, OpenVidu Server Pro process **will terminate** with an exit code of 0 if the test was successful and 1 if it failed. This property is extremely useful to test that your OpenVidu Pro deployment is working fine | ***false*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`        | URL where the Elasticsearch service of OpenVidu Pro stack is listening. OpenVidu Pro will send to that URL useful statistics of your sessions. If this parameter is explicitly set to an empty string, OpenVidu Pro will not send any data to Elasticsearch. If it is defined, then it is mandatory that OpenVidu Pro is able to establish a connection to it or start up process will fail. By default OpenVidu Pro deployments have an Elasticsearch installation in localhost | ***http://localhost:9200*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_KIBANA_HOST`        | URL where the Kibana service of OpenVidu Pro stack is listening. You can visualize Elasticsearch data in Kibana with the default dashboards provided by OpenVidu Pro, or you can create your own dashboards to better fit your necessities. If this parameter is explicitly set to an empty string, OpenVidu Pro will not connect to Kibana. If it is defined, then it is mandatory that OpenVidu Pro is able to establish a connection to it or start up process will fail. By default OpenVidu Pro deployments have a Kibana installation in localhost | ***http://localhost:5601*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_STATS_MONITORING_INTERVAL` | Interval in seconds for CPU, memory and net usage stats gathering in OpenVidu Server Pro host. Set it to **0** for no gathering at all | ***30*** |
| `OPENVIDU_PRO_STATS_WEBRTC_INTERVAL`     | Interval in seconds for WebRTC stats gathering from Media Nodes WebRTC endpoints. Set it to **0** for no gathering at all | ***30*** |

Example:

```console
java -Dopenvidu.secret=YOUR_SECRET -Dopenvidu.publicurl=https://my.openvidu.server.ip:4443/ -Dopenvidu.cdr=true -Dopenvidu.pro.cluster=true -Dopenvidu.pro.cluster.load-strategy=streams -Dopenvidu.pro.cluster.mode=auto -Dopenvidu.pro.cluster.media-nodes=3 -Dopenvidu.pro.stats.webrtc-interval=0 -jar openvidu-server-pro.jar
```
