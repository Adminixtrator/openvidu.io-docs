# openvidu-insecure-js

This is the simplest demo you can try to get started with OpenVidu. It has the minimum set of features to make a video-call. You will only need a few minutes to get your first application working.

## Understanding this example

</p>

OpenVidu is composed by the three modules displayed on the image above in its insecure version.

- **openvidu-browser**: JavaScript library for the browser. It allows you to manage your video-calls straight away from your clients
- **openvidu-server**: Java application that controls Kurento Media Server
- **Kurento Media Server**: server that handles low level operations of media flows transmission

> You will only have to make use of **openvidu-browser** to get this sample app working.

## Executing this example

1) Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git
```

2) You will need an http web server installed in your development computer to execute the sample application. If you have _node.js_ installed, you can use [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) to serve application files. It can be installed with:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

3) To run the sample application, execute the following command in the project:

```bash
http-server openvidu-insecure-js/web
```

4) _openvidu-server_ and _Kurento Media Server_ must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need [Docker CE](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)):

```bash
docker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=193.147.51.12 -e KMS_STUN_PORT=3478 -e openvidu.security=false openvidu/openvidu-server-kms
```

5) Go to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) to test the app once the server is running. The first time you use the docker container, an alert message will suggest you accept the self-signed certificate of _openvidu-server_ when you first try to join a video-call.

## Understanding the code

This application is very simple. It has only 4 files:

- `OpenVidu.js`: openvidu-browser library. You don't have to manipulate this file. 
- `app.js`: sample application main JavaScritp file, which makes use of _OpenVidu.js_. You can manipulate this file to suit your needs.
- `index.html`: HTML code for the form to connect to a video-call and for the video-call itself. You can manipulate this file to suit your needs. 
	It has two links to both JavaScript files: 

```html
<script src="OpenVidu.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

- `style.css`: some CSS classes to style _index.html_. You can manipulate this file to suit your needs.

Let's see how `app.js` uses `OpenVidu.js`:

---

**First lines declare the two variables that will be needed in different points along the code. `OV` will be our OpenVidu object and `session` the video-call we will connect to:**

```javascript
var OV;
var session;
```

---

**Let's initialize a new session and configure our events:**

```javascript
// --- 1) Get an OpenVidu object and init a session with a sessionId ---

// Init OpenVidu object
OV = new OpenVidu();

// We will join the video-call "sessionId". This parameter must start with the URL of OpenVidu Server
session = OV.initSession('wss://' + location.hostname + ':8443/' + sessionId);
```
Since we are in a local sample app, `OV` object is initialize with `localhost:8443` as its _openvidu-server_ URL. `session` object is initialize with `sessionId` param: this means we will connect to `sessionId` video-call. In this case, this parameter is retrieve from HTML input 	`<input type="text" id="sessionId" required>`, which may be filled by the user.

```javascript
// --- 2) Specify the actions when events take place ---

// On every new Stream received...
session.on('streamCreated', function (event) {

	// Subscribe to the Stream to receive it. HTML video will be appended to element with 'subscriber' id
	var subscriber = session.subscribe(event.stream, 'subscriber');

	// When the HTML video has been appended to DOM...
	subscriber.on('videoElementCreated', function (event) {

		// Add a new <p> element for the user's nickname just below its video
		appendUserData(event.element, subscriber.stream.connection);
	});
});

// On every Stream destroyed...
session.on('streamDestroyed', function (event) {

	// Delete the HTML element with the user's nickname. HTML videos are automatically removed from DOM
	removeUserData(event.stream.connection);
});
```
Here we subscribe to the events that interest us. In this case, we want to receive all videos published to the video-call, as well as displaying every user's nickname nex to its video. To achieve this:

`streamCreated`: for each new Stream received by OpenVidu, we immediately subscribe to it so we can see its video. A new HTML video element will be appended to element with id 'subscriber'. 

`videoElementCreated`: event triggered by Subscriber object (returned by the previous `Session.subscribe` method). This allows us to add the participant nickname to the new video previously added in `streamCreated` event. Auxiliary method `appendUserData` is responsible for appending a new paragraph element just below the `event.element` video, containing `subscriber.stream.connection.data` field (which has the user's nickname).

`streamDestroyed`: for each Stream that has been destroyed (which means a user has left the video-call), we remove the paragraph element with the user's nickname that we added in the previous event (`appendUserData` method created the element with an _id_ containing `event.stream.connection.connectionId` unique value, so we can now identify the right element to be removed). The video element is automatically deleted by default, so we don't need to do anything else.

---

**Finally connect to the session and publish your webcam:**

```javascript
// --- 3) Connect to the session ---

// 'token' param irrelevant when using insecure version of OpenVidu.
// Second param will be received by every user in Stream.connection.data property,
// which will be appended to DOM as the user's nickname
session.connect(token, '{"clientData": "' + token + '"}', function (error) {

	// If connection successful, initialize a publisher and publish to the session
	if (!error) {

		// --- 4) Get your own camera stream with the desired resolution ---

		// Both audio and video will be active. HTML video element will be
		// appended to element with 'publisher' id
		var publisher = OV.initPublisher('publisher', {
			audio: true,
			video: true,
			quality: 'MEDIUM'
		});

		// --- 5) Publish your stream ---

		session.publish(publisher);

	} else {
		console.log('There was an error connecting to the session:', error.code, error.message);
	}
});
```
	
`token` param is irrelevant when using insecure version of OpenVidu. Remember `videoElementCreated` event, when we added the user's nickname to the HTML? Well, second parameter is the actual value you will receive in `Stream.connection.data` property. So in this case it is a JSON formatted string with a "clientData" tag with "token" value, which is retrieved from HTML input `<input type="text" id="participantId" required>` (filled by the user).

In the callback of `Session.connect` method, we check the connection has been succesful (`error` value must be _null_) and right after that we get a `Publisher` object with both audio and video activated and MEDIUM quality. This process will end with the addition of a new HTML video element showing your camera, as a child of element with _id_ 'publisher'. We then just have to publish this object through `Session.publish` method, and the rest of users will begin receiving our webcam.
